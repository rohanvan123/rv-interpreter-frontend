## Live Deployment - [Try it Out!](https://rv-interpreter-frontend.vercel.app/)

This project is currently hosted on **Vercel** and the Flask backend on **Render**. Initial requests may be very slow because it's based on Render's free tier.

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Additionally have the flask backend running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
